# react-axios-rest-api

simple project to practice restful api using axios and react

1 - api that is used is http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

2 - with the help of axios the response is fetched and state is updated using setState

3 - it's so simple and is done with the help of the two points above

4 - I tried with my own api generated with django on port 8000 but I caught an error
this repo would be updated after finding the reason
